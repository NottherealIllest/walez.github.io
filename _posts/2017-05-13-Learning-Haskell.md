I have decided to take a look at the functional programming paradigm and I chose [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) as the lens through which I get a glimpse of the greatness.

In order to have a more structured learning path, I have decided to start with [Learn you Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) and also switch to using haskell to solve my hackerrank problems.

Will update the blog with tidbits of things learnt during this journey into functional land.

### Resources
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- [Stackoverflow question on learning Haskell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell)
- [Learn you Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)
- [Ninety Nine Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

### Conclusion

While I probably would not be using haskell on a work/client project any time soon, I am sure that in the mean time the techniques and patterns learned from a functional perspective will prove usefull,
